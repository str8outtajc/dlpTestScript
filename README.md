# dlpTestScript
Quick dirty script to generate fake PII for DLP testing

Tested only on macOS Catalina and up (including Big Sur Dev Beta)

Script creates 1,000 CSV files with 1,000 rows each.
Each row contains a fake "Customer ID," "SSN," and "VISA"

Useful for testing crappy DLP agents that your Cyber people want you to run on your Macs, because they don't understand modern DLP stategies.
